# Trackster

A music search app using the MusicGraph API. The app has a text input field and a search button. When a user inputs some text and clicks the button, the app will search MusicGraph's database for songs related to that text. When the API request is complete, the app displays each song found in a list. The user can then sort the list in a number of ways and listen to a sample of each song via a play button.
